## Description

This project was done as an exercise in Bootstrap and CSS assigned by my instructor at the GT Coding Bootcamp. My objective was to use pre-existing Bootstrap components to create and style a three-page, responsive, professional website for myself that included a biography page, a portfolio page, and a contact me page. We learned to use columns and rows (grid system) to shape and space out the contents of a page by using reference photos of completed webpages taken at different screen widths. Our final goal was to have a deployed, responsive biography website that would look presentable on any screen size.
